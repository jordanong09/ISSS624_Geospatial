```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      eval = TRUE,
                      warning = FALSE,
                      message = FALSE)
```

## Libraries

For this analysis, we will use the following packages from CRAN.

-   [`sf`](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html) - Support for simple features, a standardized way to encode spatial vector data. Binds to 'GDAL' for reading and writing data, to 'GEOS' for geometrical operations, and to 'PROJ' for projection conversions and datum transformations. Uses by default the 's2' package for spherical geometry operations on ellipsoidal (long/lat) coordinates.
-   [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) - Loading the core tidyverse packages which will be used for data wrangling and visualisation.
-   [`tmap`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/index.html) - Thematic maps are geographical maps in which spatial data distributions are visualized. This package offers a flexible, layer-based, and easy to use approach to create thematic maps, such as choropleths and bubble maps.
-   [`spdep`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spdep/index.html) - A collection of functions to create spatial weights matrix objects from polygon 'contiguities', from point patterns by distance and tessellations, for summarizing these objects, and for permitting their use in spatial data analysis, including regional aggregation by minimum spanning tree; a collection of tests for spatial 'autocorrelation'

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, spdep, tmap, tidyverse)
```

## Data Preparation

Two dataset will be used for this study:

-   Hunan.shp: A shapefile of the Hunan Province that consist of all the capital
-   Hunan.csv: A csv file containing multiple attributes of each capital within Hunan

### Importing of data

We will use the *st_read* to import the shape file and *read_csv* to import the aspatial data into the R environment. We will then use a relational join *left_join* to combine the spatial and aspatial data together.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
hunan <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", 
                 layer = "Hunan")

hunan2012 <- read_csv("data/aspatial/Hunan_2012.csv")


hunan <- left_join(hunan,hunan2012)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
hunan <- readRDS("data/rds/hunan.rds")
```

## Visualisation of spatial data

For the visualisation, we will only be using `tmap`. We will prepare a basemap anbd a choropleth map to visualise the distribution of GDP per capita among the capital.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
basemap <- tm_shape(hunan) +
  tm_polygons() +
  tm_text("NAME_3", size=0.4)

gdppc <- qtm(hunan, "GDPPC")

tmap_arrange(basemap, gdppc, asp=1, ncol=2)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="base map and choropleth map"}
knitr::include_graphics("tmap01.png")
```

## Computing Contiguity Spatial Weights

Contiguity means that two spatial units share a common border of non-zero length. There are multiple criterion of contiguity such as:

-   **Rook**: When only common sides of the polygons are considered to define the neighbor relation (common vertices are ignored).
-   **Queen**: The difference between the rook and queen criterion to determine neighbors is that the latter also includes common vertices.
-   **Bishop**: Is based on the existence of common vertices between two spatial units.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Contiguity Weights"}
knitr::include_graphics("contiguity.png")
```

Except in the simplest of circumstances, visual examination or manual calculation cannot be used to create the spatial weights from the geometry of the data. It is necessary to utilize explicit spatial data structures to deal with the placement and layout of the polygons in order to determine whether two polygons are contiguous.

We will use the [`poly2nb`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/spdep/versions/1.2-7/topics/poly2nb) function to construct neighbours list based on the regions with contiguous boundaries. Based on the documentation, user will be able to pass a `queen` argument that takes in True or False. The argument the default is set to TRUE, that is, if you don't specify queen = FALSE this function will return a list of first order neighbours using the Queen criteria.

### Computing (QUEEN) contiguity based neighbour

The code chunk below is used to compute Queen contiguity weight matrix.

```{r}
wm_q <- poly2nb(hunan)
summary(wm_q)
```

based on the summary report above,the report shows that there are 88 area units in Hunan. The most connected area unit has 11 neighbours. There are two area units with only one neighbours.

For each polygon in our polygon object, wm_q lists all neighboring polygons. For example, to see the neighbors for the first polygon in the object, type:

```{r}
wm_q[[1]]
```

Polygon 1 has 5 neighbors. The numbers represent the polygon IDs as stored in hunan SpatialPolygonsDataFrame class.

To reveal the county names of the five neighboring polygons, the code chunk will be used:

```{r}
hunan$NAME_3[c(2,3,4,57,85)]
```

We can retrieve the GDPPC of these five countries by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
hunan$GDPPC[wm_q[[1]]]
```

The printed output above shows that the GDPPC of the five nearest neighbours based on Queen's method are 20981, 34592, 24473, 21311 and 22879 respectively.

You can display the complete weight matrix by using str().

```{r}
str(wm_q)
```

### Computing (ROOK) contiguity based neighbour

The code chunk below is used to compute Rook contiguity weight matrix.

```{r}
wm_r <- poly2nb(hunan, queen=FALSE)
summary(wm_r)
```

The summary report above shows that there are 88 area units in Hunan. The most connect area unit has 10 neighbours. There are two area units with only one heighbours.

### Visualising the weights matrix

A connectivity graph takes a point and displays a line to each neighboring point. We are working with polygons at the moment, so we will need to get points in order to make our connectivity graphs. The most typically method for this will be polygon centroids. To retrieve the centroid of each area, we will use the `st_centroid` function.

```{r}
coords <- st_centroid(st_geometry(hunan))
```

#### Plotting Queen and Rook contiguity based neighbours map

```{r, fig.align='center'}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))

plot(st_geometry(hunan), border="grey", main = "Queen Contiguity")
plot(wm_q, coords,pch = 19, cex = 0.6, add = TRUE, col= "red")

plot(st_geometry(hunan), border="grey", main = "Rook Contiguity")
plot(wm_r, coords,pch = 19, cex = 0.6, add = TRUE, col= "blue")
```

## Computing distance based neighbours

In this section, you will learn how to derive distance-based weight matrices by using [`dnearneigh()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/dnearneigh.html) of **spdep** package. The function identifies neighbours of region points by Euclidean distance in the metric of the points between lower (greater than or equal to and upper (less than or equal to) bounds.

### Determine the cut-off distance

Firstly, we need to determine the upper limit for distance band by using the steps below:

-   Return a matrix with the indices of points belonging to the set of the k nearest neighbours of each other by using [*knearneigh()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/knearneigh.html) of **spdep**.

-   Convert the knn object returned by *knearneigh()* into a neighbours list of class nb with a list of integer vectors containing neighbour region number ids by using [*knn2nb()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/knn2nb.html).

-   Return the length of neighbour relationship edges by using [*nbdists()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/nbdists.html) of **spdep**. The function returns in the units of the coordinates if the coordinates are projected, in km otherwise.

-   Remove the list structure of the returned object by using [**unlist()**](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/unlist).

```{r}
k1 <- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords))
k1dists <- unlist(nbdists(k1, coords))
summary(k1dists)
```

The summary report shows that the largest first nearest neighbour distance is 58.25 km, so using this as the upper threshold gives certainty that all units will have at least one neighbour.

### Computing fixed distance weight matrix

Now, we will compute the distance weight matrix by using *dnearneigh()* as shown in the code chunk below.

```{r}
wm_d59 <- dnearneigh(coords, 0, 59)
wm_d59
```

The report shows that on average, every area should have at least 3 neighbours (links).

To display the structure of the weight matrix is to combine [*table()*](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/table) and [*card()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/card.html) of spdep.

```{r}
head(table(hunan$County, card(wm_d59)),10)
```

### Visualising distance weight matrix

The left graph with the red lines show the links of 1st nearest neighbours and the right graph with the black lines show the links of neighbours within the cut-off distance of 59km.

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(hunan$geometry, border="lightgrey", main="1st nearest neighbours")
plot(k1, coords, add=TRUE, col="red", length=0.08)
plot(hunan$geometry, border="lightgrey", main="Distance link")
plot(wm_d59, coords, add=TRUE, pch = 19, cex = 0.6)
```

### Adaptive distance weight matrix

Other than using distance as a criteria to decide the neighbours, it is possible to control the numbers of neighbours directly using k-nearest neighbours, either accepting asymmetric neighbours or imposing symmetry as shown in the code chunk below:

```{r}
knn6 <- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords, k=6)) #k refers to the number of neighbours per area
knn6
```

#### Plotting adaptive distance weight

We can plot the adaptive distance weight matrix using the code chunk below:

```{r}
plot(hunan$geometry, border="lightgrey", main = "Adaptive Distance Weight")
plot(knn6, coords, pch = 19, cex = 0.6, add = TRUE, col = "red")
```

### Weights based on Inversed Distance Weighting (IDW)

In this section, you will learn how to derive a spatial weight matrix based on Inversed Distance method.

First, we will compute the distances between areas by using *nbdists()* of **spdep**.

We will use the \[`lapply()`\] (https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/lapply) to apply the inverse function through the list.

```{r}
dist <- nbdists(wm_q, coords, longlat = TRUE)
ids <- lapply(dist, function(x) 1/(x))
head(ids,5)
```

Next, we will use the [`nb2listw`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/spdep/versions/1.2-7/topics/nb2listw) to apply the weights list with values given by the coding scheme style chosen. There are multiple style to choose from:

-   B (Basic Binary Coding)
-   W (Row Standardised) - sums over all links to n
-   C (Globally Standardised) - sums over all links to n
-   U (Globally Standardised / No of neighbours) - sums over all links to unity
-   S (Variance-Stabilizing Coding Scheme) - sums over all links to n
-   minmax - divides the weights by the minimum of the maximum row sums and maximum column sums of the input weights

For the simplifed analysis, we will use the W (Row Standardised).

```{r}
rswm_q <- nb2listw(wm_q, style="W", zero.policy = TRUE)
rswm_q
```

From the earlier example, we know that the first Id has 5 neighbours. We take a look at the weight distribution of these 5 neighours. Since we are using Row Standardised, they should be equal.

```{r}
rswm_q$weights[1]
```

Each neighbor is assigned a 0.2 of the total weight. This means that when R computes the average neighboring income values, each neighbor's income will be multiplied by 0.2 before being tallied.

## Application of Spatial Weight Matrix

In this section, you will learn how to create four different spatial lagged variables, they are:

-   spatial lag with row-standardized weights
-   spatial lag as a sum of neighbouring values
-   spatial window average
-   spatial window sum

### Spatial lag with row-standardized weights

Firstly, we'll compute the average neighbor GDPPC value for each polygon using the [`lag.listw()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/spdep/versions/1.1-3/topics/lag.listw) that can compute the lag of a vector. These values are often referred to as spatially lagged values.

```{r}
GDPPC.lag <- lag.listw(rswm_q, hunan$GDPPC)
head(GDPPC.lag)
```

In the previous section, we retrieved the GDPPC of the neighbours of the first area by using the following code chunk:

```{r}
hunan$GDPPC[wm_q[[1]]]
```

From this, we can understand that the spatial lag with row-standardized weights is actually the average GDPPC of its neighbours.

$$(20981+34592+24473+21311+22879/5 = 24847.20)$$

We will now append these lagged values to our `Hunan` data frame.

```{r}

lag.df <- as.data.frame(list(hunan$NAME_3,GDPPC.lag))
colnames(lag.df) <- c("NAME_3", "lag GDPPC")
hunan <- left_join(hunan,lag.df)
```

Next, we will plot both the GDPPC and spatial lag GDPPC for comparison using the code chunk below.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
gdppc <- tm_shape(hunan) +
  tm_fill("GDPPC") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "GDPPC without lagged values", main.title.size = 0.7, legend.text.size = 0.4,
            main.title.fontface = "bold",main.title.position = "center")
  
lag_gdppc <- tm_shape(hunan) +
  tm_fill("lag GDPPC") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "GDPPC with lagged values", main.title.size = 0.7, legend.text.size = 0.4,
            main.title.fontface = "bold",main.title.position = "center")
tmap_arrange(gdppc, lag_gdppc, asp=1, ncol=2)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="GDPPC vs lag GDPPC"}
knitr::include_graphics("tmap02.png")
```

### Spatial lag as a sum of neighboring values

We can calculate spatial lag as a sum of neighboring values by assigning binary weights. This requires us to go back to our neighbors list, then apply a function that will assign binary weights, then we use glist = in the nb2listw function to explicitly assign these weights.

We start by applying a function that will assign a value of 1 per each neighbor. This is done with lapply, which we have been using to manipulate the neighbors structure throughout the past notebooks. Basically it applies a function across each value in the neighbors structure.

```{r}
b_weights <- lapply(wm_q, function(x) 0*x + 1)

b_weights2 <- nb2listw(wm_q, 
                       glist = b_weights, 
                       style = "B")
b_weights2

```

With the proper weights assigned, we can use lag.listw to compute a lag variable from our weight and GDPPC.

```{r}
lag_df <- as.data.frame (list(hunan$NAME_3, lag.listw(b_weights2, hunan$GDPPC)))
colnames(lag_df) <- c("NAME_3", "lag_sum GDPPC")
hunan <- left_join(hunan, lag_df)

lag_df

```

From the above data table and the GDPPC from the previous section, we know that the lagged sum is the addition of all the GDPPC of its neighbours.

$$(20981+34592+24473+21311+22879 = 124236)$$

```{r, eval = FALSE}
gdppc <- tm_shape(hunan) +
  tm_fill("GDPPC") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "GDPPC without lagged values", main.title.size = 0.7, legend.text.size = 0.4,
            main.title.fontface = "bold",main.title.position = "center")
  
lag_gdppc <- tm_shape(hunan) +
  tm_fill("lag GDPPC") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "GDPPC with lagged values", main.title.size = 0.7, legend.text.size = 0.4,
            main.title.fontface = "bold",main.title.position = "center")

lag_sum_gdppc <- tm_shape(hunan) +
  tm_fill("lag_sum GDPPC") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "GDPPC with lagged sum values", main.title.size = 0.7, legend.text.size = 0.4,
            main.title.fontface = "bold",main.title.position = "center")

tmap_arrange(gdppc, lag_gdppc, lag_sum_gdppc, asp=1, ncol=3)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="GDPPC vs lag GDPPC vs lag sum GDPPC"}
knitr::include_graphics("tmap03.png")
```

### Spatial Window Average

The spatial window average uses row-standardized weights and includes the diagonal element. (region itself) We will use the [`include.self()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/include.self.html).

```{r}

wm_q_self <- include.self(wm_q)

```

We will now obtain the weight and retrieve the new spatial window average and combine it with our exisiting `Hunan` dataframe.

```{r}
wm_q_self_list <- nb2listw(wm_q_self)
lag_w_avg_gpdpc <- lag.listw(wm_q_self_list, 
                             hunan$GDPPC)

lag_w_avg_df <- as.data.frame(list(hunan$NAME_3, lag_w_avg_gpdpc))

colnames(lag_w_avg_df) <- c("NAME_3", "lag_window_avg GDPPC")

hunan <- left_join(hunan, lag_w_avg_df)

```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
gdppc <- tm_shape(hunan) +
  tm_fill("GDPPC") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "GDPPC without lagged values", main.title.size = 0.7, legend.text.size = 0.4,
            main.title.fontface = "bold",main.title.position = "center")
  
lag_gdppc <- tm_shape(hunan) +
  tm_fill("lag GDPPC") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "GDPPC with lagged values", main.title.size = 0.7, legend.text.size = 0.4,
            main.title.fontface = "bold",main.title.position = "center")

lag_sum_gdppc <- tm_shape(hunan) +
  tm_fill("lag_sum GDPPC") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "GDPPC with lagged sum values", main.title.size = 0.7, legend.text.size = 0.4,
            main.title.fontface = "bold",main.title.position = "center")

lag_sum_avg_gdppc <- tm_shape(hunan) +
  tm_fill("lag_window_avg GDPPC") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "GDPPC with lagged average values", main.title.size = 0.7, legend.text.size = 0.4,
            main.title.fontface = "bold",main.title.position = "center")

tmap_arrange(gdppc, lag_gdppc, lag_sum_gdppc, lag_sum_avg_gdppc, asp=1, ncol=2)

```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="GDPPC vs lag GDPPC vs lag sum GDPPC vs lag avg GDPPC"}
knitr::include_graphics("tmap04.png")
```

#### Spatial Window Sum

The spatial Window sum is similar to the window average but using the binary weights. Therefore we will repeat the following steps of the `Spatial lag as a sum of neighboring values` and to include its own region.

```{r}
b_weights <- lapply(wm_q_self, function(x) 0*x + 1)
b_weights[1]
```

From the result, we can see now the first area instead of **5** neighbours, it has **6** neighbours which include itself. We will now retrieve the spatial window sum and combine it with our exisiting `Hunan` dataframe.

```{r}
b_weights2 <- nb2listw(wm_q_self, 
                       glist = b_weights, 
                       style = "B")
w_sum_gdppc_df <- as.data.frame(list(hunan$NAME_3, lag.listw(b_weights2, hunan$GDPPC)))
colnames(w_sum_gdppc_df) <- c("NAME_3", "w_sum GDPPC")

hunan <- left_join(hunan, w_sum_gdppc_df)
```

We will now visualise all the plots we created and visualise the difference in each method (excluding the original GDPPC).

```{r, eval = FALSE}

lag_gdppc <- tm_shape(hunan) +
  tm_fill("lag GDPPC") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "GDPPC with lagged values", main.title.size = 0.7, legend.text.size = 0.4,
            main.title.fontface = "bold",main.title.position = "center")

lag_sum_gdppc <- tm_shape(hunan) +
  tm_fill("lag_sum GDPPC") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "GDPPC with lagged sum values", main.title.size = 0.7, legend.text.size = 0.4,
            main.title.fontface = "bold",main.title.position = "center")

lag_sum_avg_gdppc <- tm_shape(hunan) +
  tm_fill("lag_window_avg GDPPC") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "GDPPC with lagged average values", main.title.size = 0.7, legend.text.size = 0.4,
            main.title.fontface = "bold",main.title.position = "center")

lag_sum_window_gdppc <- tm_shape(hunan) +
  tm_fill("w_sum GDPPC") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "GDPPC with lagged sum average values", main.title.size = 0.7, legend.text.size = 0.4,
            main.title.fontface = "bold",main.title.position = "center")

tmap_arrange(lag_gdppc, lag_sum_gdppc, lag_sum_avg_gdppc, lag_sum_window_gdppc, asp=1, ncol=2)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="lag GDPPC vs lag sum GDPPC vs lag avg GDPPC vs lag sum avg GDPPC"}
knitr::include_graphics("tmap05.png")
```

## Conclusion

This study allow us to understand the different contiguity spatial weights and different methods to utilise the neighbours information. There is no best method but which method suits your analysis of your work.
