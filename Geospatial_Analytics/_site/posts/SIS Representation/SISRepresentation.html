<p>In this article, I will share how we can leverage on Static, Interactive and Statistical (SIS) graphs to conduct appropriate data visualisation and draw statistical conclusion from the data set. In this article, we will explore varios libraries such as <code>parsetR</code>, <code>ggstatsplot</code> and <code>ggplot</code>.</p>
</section>
<section id="libraries" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="libraries">Libraries</h2>
<p>Instead of using the base R function such as <code>library()</code> or <code>install.packages()</code>,we will use the p_load function from the <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/pacman/versions/0.5.1"><code>pacman</code></a> package that combine these functions together. Before using the package, you will need to install the package from CRAN.</p>

<p>For this analysis, we will use the following packages from CRAN.</p>
<p><a href="https://rdrr.io/github/timelyportfolio/parsetR/man/parsetR.html"><code>parsetR</code></a> - Visualize your data with interactive d3.js parallel sets with the power and convenience of an htmlwidget.<br>
<a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/"><code>tidyverse</code></a> - Loading the core tidyverse packages which will be used for data wrangling and visualisation.<br>
<a href="https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/"><code>ggstatsplot</code></a> - An extension of <code>ggplot2</code> package for creating graphics with details from statistical tests included in the information-rich plots themselves.<br>
<a href="https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/"><code>patchwork</code></a> - Combine separate ggplots into the same graphic.</p>

<p>To reduce the requirement to upload the original data set, I will use the <code>saveRDS</code> function to convert my working tibble dataframe to a R data format namely <em>.rds</em>. We will subsequently use the <code>readRDS</code> function to read the data files in R.</p>

<p>Through the data from the participants, we can identify a total of 1011 participants ad 6 different attributes. The finance data shows the timestamp of the participants log and a category column. It seems like the data is in the <code>long</code> format and therefore we will subsequently pivot the data table to a <code>wide</code> format. We can also see that household size should be a categorical data rather than a numerical data. We address these issues using the <code>dplyr</code> package.</p>

<p>We will now examine how many different input categories are there. There are 6 different categories and 1011 participants throughout the period of 1 year and 2 months based on the timestamp. There should be a total of 2,547,720 financial records but the total recorded data was only 1,856,330. This shows some participants might not have recorded their finance throughout the period. We will now identify participants that are not consistent in their input.</p>

<li><code>geom_text()</code> is used to add annotations of the count and % values for <code>geom_bar()</code></li>
<li>Grids and background color are removed for a cleaner look as annotations are included.</li>

<p>We will now analyse the data using interactive graphs such as parallel set plot. We will leverage on the <code>parset</code> library to provide interactive function. The interesting feature about the <code>parset</code> function is that it allows the user to dynamically shift the levels of the attributes (top-bottom and left-right), providing the user a more interactive visualisation of the data set.</p>

<p>From the Parset plot, we identify a few probable relationship such as Education Level to Income Level etc. We will now use statistical plot to verify our claim. The <code>ggstatsplot</code> library provides a suite of statistical plot to allow user to choose the plot based on its data set. For this study, since our attributes are in categorical form, I will leverage on the <a href="https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/ggbarstats.html"><code>ggbarstats</code></a>.</p>

<p>Pearson’s <span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span>-test of independence revealed that, across 880 participants,there was a significant association between Income Level, Education Level and Joviality Level. (p-value below alpha value of 0.05). The Bayes Factor for the left analysis revealed that the data were <span class="math inline">\(8e^{66}\)</span> times more probable under the alternative hypothesis as compared to the null hypothesis. This can be considered extreme evidence <a href="https://www.ejwagenmakers.com/2015/AndraszewiczEtAl2015.pdf">(Sandra Andraszewicz, 2015)</a> in favor of the alternative hypothesis. The Bayes Factor for the right analysis revealed that the data were 23968348874 times more probable under the alternative hypothesis as compared to the null hypothesis. This can also be considered extreme evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It is important for data analyst to understand the importance of static and interactive graphs, how we should leverage these tools to provide appropriate data visualisation and subsequently use statistical graphs to draw statistical conclusion to support the hypothesis.</p>
